Prototype:
1) Creational Pattern
2) Used to copy an instantiated object
3) Clones do not use keyword new
4) Usually implemented with a Registry to store original object and clones
5) Shallow Copies do not store differences between original registry and cloned registry
6) Deep Copies store and return changes
7) Used by implementing Cloneable or Prototype interfaces in object class
8) Used to help create multiple instances of an object quickly
9) Prototypes avoid costly creation
10) Avoids subclassing
11) Often uses an interface for prototype instance
12) Can utilize parameters in a clone method for construction
13) A deep copy doesn't depend on its clone
14 )A shallow copy depends on its clone and is mutatable
15) it is better to use a deep copy
